        <p>Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election due to losing the swing states to Donald Trump. She desprately needed those votes to win so she spent a large portion of her short bid to presidency campaigning in states like Pensylvania, Michigan, and Geogia. </p>
            
           <p> One state she did not spend much time in was Maryland. Typically voting blue, it would not have been a valuable use of her time. According to a report from <a href="https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/10/01/maryland-presidential-election-history-2024/" target="_blank"> Capital News Service</a>, out of the last 15 general elections, the state has only voted Republican three times. Data from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/results/2024/11/05/maryland-president/" target="_blank"> Washington Post's live election coverage </a>shows which counties are responsible for the blue dominance.</p>
