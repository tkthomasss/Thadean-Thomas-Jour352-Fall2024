                            as chief of staff means being mistaken for the intern, having your outfits go viral, dating

                        On a Monday night in mid-September, a dozen chiefs of staff for members of the U.S. House of
                        Representatives gather at a swanky hotel bar in Washington, D.C.’s Navy Yard neighborhood to
                        catch up and unwind before Congress opens session in the morning. You might be conjuring a dark,
                        stuffy room full of whiskey, cigars, and men in bad suits rubbing elbows, but these are not your
                        parents’ chiefs of staff. Instead, a group of young, diverse, stylish women fills the room,
                        ordering Chardonnay, martinis, and girl-dinner bites. One wears a denim set and faux-cowhide
                        mules, her platinum blonde hair perfectly blown out. Another is in silver vegan leather capris,
                        a black silk button-down, and oversize teardrop earrings. There is not one shift dress, pearl
                        necklace, or even a hint of khaki in sight.

                        Congress is about halfway through its final session before the election, and the vibes are
                        weird. With their futures unknown, a palpable sense of uncertainty hangs in the air. Will they
                        all still have jobs after the votes have been tallied?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The chiefs seem happy to have the gang back together after summer break. Over the course of three hours, they vent about their nonexistent dating lives and about bosses who drone on for hours (one woman tells me she sometimes mutes herself, puts her boss on speakerphone, and continues to watch her TV show). But their days here in DC are numbered. Soon, most of them will take leaves from their Hill jobs and fan out across the country to volunteer on campaigns to help secure a victory for their representative, or if they are in a safe district, for vulnerable members elsewhere.</p>

                    “Homegirl is tired,” says Hannah Spengler, 34, chief of staff to Rep. Don Davis (D-NC). “It’s nonstop, especially right now. It’s just the constant pressure of knowing that we have, if not the toughest race in the country, one of the very toughest.” Heavy is the head of a chief: “If we don’t win, all of my staff will lose their jobs. It adds a new layer of responsibility,” says Chloe Hunt, 31, chief of staff to Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL). “Of course, I want him to win because I think he has great policies and is the right person to represent our district, but I also have been managing all of these people who will physically be out of a job if we don’t do our part to make sure that he wins.”
